# Neural Style Transfer API

Little project of neural style transfer algorithm implemented.


### Running

It can me runned as an API to receive POST requests. Give it a content image and a style image and it will transfer the style of one image into the other.



```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```
python app.py
```

Now you can send requests via cURL with your images :)
